                <p class="description"> Currently a Third Year <span class="highlight">BBIT Student</span> at the <span class="highlight">University of Embu</span>.</p>
                <h1>From Booting Up to Building Empires</h1>
                <p>I wasn't a natural in the academic world, especially when it came to the theoretical side of BBIT (Bachelor of Business and Information Technology) program.
                   Growing up, I was more hands-on, taking apart electronics and tinkering with software, but formal education often felt like a chore.
                    My early academic experiences in the BBIT program were marked by:<br>

                  1. Struggling with theory: <br>
                  Concepts like database management, networking protocols, and business strategy felt abstract and disconnected from the practical application, I craved.<br>
                  2. Difficulty focusing in lectures:<br>
                   Long lectures filled with jargon and complex diagrams often left me feeling lost and overwhelmed.<br>
                  3. Procrastination:<br>
                   Feeling discouraged, I would often put off studying until the last minute, leading to rushed work and poor grades.<br>
                </p>

                <div class="image-content">
                  <img src="images/paraone.jpg" alt="Kelvin Glance" class="responsive-image">
                </div>

                  <p>My first year was particularly tough. I barely passed some core modules and started to doubt if I was cut out for the program.
                   However, a few key events shifted my perspective:<br>
                  
                  1. Discovering coding:<br>
                   In a programming elective, something clicked. I found the logic of coding intuitive and enjoyed the immediate feedback of seeing my code come to life.<br>
                  2. Finding a mentor:<br>
                   A senior BBIT student, noticed my struggles and offered to mentor me. She helped me connect the theoretical concepts to real-world applications and introduced me to online resources and coding communities.<br>
                  3. Participating in a hackathon: <br>
                  She encouraged me to join a local hackathon. The pressure of building a working prototype in a short time forced me to apply the knowledge practically, solidifying my understanding and boosting my confidence.<br>
                  </p>

                    <img src="images/paratwo.png" alt="Kelvin Glance" class="responsive-image">
                  </div>

                  <p>This experiences ignited a passion in me. I started spending more time in the computer lab, experimenting with different programming languages and building small projects.
                   I found that by applying the theoretical knowledge in practical ways, it became much easier to understand and retain. Despite the initial setbacks, I persevered.<br>
                  </p>

                  <div class="image-content">
                    <img src="images/parathree.jpg" alt="Kelvin Glance" class="responsive-image">
                  </div>

                  <p>Some of the challenges I faced were:<br>
                  
                  1. Balancing coursework with personal projects:
                   Juggling academic assignments with my growing interest in personal coding projects required careful time management.<br>
                  2. Dealing with imposter syndrome:<br>
                   Even as my skills improved, sometimes I felt like I didn't belong in the tech world.<br>
                  3. Navigating the job market:<br>
                   Finding internships and entry-level positions required networking and building a strong portfolio.<br>
                  But I learned to leverage my strengths. I focused on developing a strong portfolio of projects, actively participated in online forums, and networked with professionals in the field.<br>
                 </p>

                </div>

                  <p>Years later, I'm not just a BBIT undergraduate; I'm a successful software developer leading a team at a thriving tech startup.
                   I had turned my initial struggles into a strength, understanding the importance of both theory and practice.<br>
                    My journey, from a struggling BBIT student to a respected tech professional, proved that with passion, mentorship, 
                    and a willingness to learn, anyone can overcome academic challenges and build a successful career in the tech industry</p>
